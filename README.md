## Description

This project contains a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function takes the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned.

Usage
1. The user is prompted to enter the original price of an item.
2. The user is then prompted to enter the discount percentage.
3. The `calculate_discount` function is called with the provided inputs.
4. The final price after applying the discount (if applicable) is printed


## How to Run
